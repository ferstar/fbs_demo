# fbs demo
This demo shows how you can use [fbs](https://build-system.fman.io) and [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) to
create a simple Python GUI and an associated installer.

> Once you push a commit, the binary package will be packed and published to release by GitHub Actions service in several minutes.

> See my [workflow file](https://github.com/ferstar/fbs_demo/blob/main/.github/workflows/build.yml) for more details.
